Uh, uh, check it out (yeah), uh
Junior M.A.F.I.A., uh (he-he)
Uh (I like this) yeah, yeah
Nine-fo' (keep bangin')
To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical douches in your bushes (uh)
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mamis?
The back of the club, sippin' Moët is where you'll find me (what?)
The back of the club, mackin' -, my crew's behind me (uh)
Mad question askin', - passin'
Music blastin', but I just can't quit
Because one of these honeys Biggie got to creep with (that's right)
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret, why not? (Uh)
Why blow up my spot 'cause we both got hot?
Now check it, I got more mack than Craig, and in the bed
Believe me, sweetie, I got enough to feed the needy (come on)
No need to be greedy, I got mad friends with Benzes
C-notes by the layers, true to life players (uh)
Jump in the Rover and come over, tell your friends jump in the GS3
I got the - by the tree (let's go)
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
To the honeys gettin' money, playin' fellas like dummies
I love it when you call me Big Poppa
You got a - up in your waist, please don't shoot up the place (why?)
'Cause I see some ladies tonight that should be havin' my baby (uh), baby (uh)
Straight up, honey, really I'm askin'
Most of these fellas think they be mackin', but they be actin'
Who they attractin' with that line (what?), "What's your name? What's your sign?"
Soon as he buy that wine, I just creep up from behind (that's right)
And ask you what your interests are, who you be with
Things that make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while? I'm gon' go call my crew, you go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around two (come on)
Plans to leave, throw the keys to Little Cease (uh-huh)
Pull the truck up front, and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly, go fill my belly (G)
A T-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, 'cause Uh, uh, check it out (yeah), uh
